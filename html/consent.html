                    I am a doctoral student enrolled in the School/Clinical Psy.D. program at Pace University in New York City, New York. I am conducting a study on the use of emotion words in bilingual Spanish-English speakers. You have been asked to participate in this study because you have indicated that you are a bilingual Spanish-English speaker. You can help provide information that will increase our understanding of how language and emotion are experienced in bilingual individuals.

                    Your participation will require completing an online test. You will be asked to click on a hyperlink that will connect to a webpage where you will answer questions about your language history and current language exposure. You will then move on to the test, which involves viewing words on a screen and clicking on your keyboard to provide a response. The words you will see may range from common words to words that are usually considered taboo, such as curse words. The study will last approximately 30 minutes. The risks involved in participation are similar to the shock or discomfort that you may experience upon exposure to these words in everyday life. There are no direct benefits for participation in this study. If you choose to participate and complete the study, you may select to be included in a raffle for a $100 American Express Gift Card. The chances of winning will depend on the total number of participants.

                    Your participation in this study is voluntary and confidential. If you choose to participate and later decide not to continue, you may end your participation at any time without explanation. Identifying personal information is not required to complete the study. Any demographic information or responses that you provide will be recorded anonymously and tallied only in the context of data collection. If you choose to participate in the raffle upon completing the study, you will be asked to provide your name and a contact email to be used if you are selected in the drawing. This information will be kept separate from any data collected in the study.

                    The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Pace University protects the rights of research participants and has approved the solicitation of participants in this study.
