            This study explores how bilinguals process certain types of emotional information that are expressed through language. 
            It compares how long participants take to respond to emotion words in Spanish and in English to see if there are differences in the way this information is processed depending on language.
            You were shown a variety of emotion words that included neutral words, positive words, negative words, and taboo words. 
            These are words that generally cause different reactions according to their category, which may have affected your ability to answer prompts quickly and accurately.
            The researcher expects to find (1) that it takes longer for participants to respond as the word becomes more emotionally charged and (2) that participants will take longer to respond in Spanish, their first language, with length of the delay increasing as the words become increasingly more jarring.
            Studies like these can improve our understanding of the unconscious differences between monolingual and bilingual use of emotional language. <br />Because psychology focuses so heavily on understanding the affective experiences of others, and because bilingualism is growing exponentially in the US, this information is particularly valuable to the field.
