WHY IS THIS RESEARCH STUDY BEING DONE?

The purpose of this research study is to increase our understanding of how language is recognized by bilingual individuals.

HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?

This study will enroll approximately 40 participants.  All study procedures will be conducted online, through a website that participants may access by clicking the hyperlink (or copy-and-pasting the web address) available on the invitation email.

WHAT PROCEDURES ARE INVOLVED WITH THIS STUDY AND HOW LONG WILL THEY TAKE?

1.	Participation will require the completion of one online study that is composed of five sections:

    1)	Informed Consent: approximately 8 minutes
    2)	Demographics: approximately 1 minute
    3)	Experimental Task: approximately 10 minutes
    4)	Language History Questionnaire: approximately 8 minutes
    5)	Debriefing: approximately 4 minutes

2.	Participation in the study will include one session and take a total of about 30 minutes.

    You must meet the following requirements to be in the study: 18 years of age or older; bilingual in Spanish and English, with Spanish as your first language; currently residing in the United States.

WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE DISCOMFORTS OR RISKS RELATED TO THE STUDY?

    There are no known harms or discomforts associated with this study beyond those encountered in normal daily life. The words you will see may range from common words to words that are usually considered taboo, such as curse words. The possible risks and/or discomforts associated with the procedures described in this study may include fleeting feelings of shock or embarrassment that are commensurate to what you may experience upon exposure to these words in everyday life.

    Participant Benefits
    You will not directly benefit from participation in this study.

    Benefits to Others or Society
    Potential benefits to society include the collection of information that may increase our understanding of how language is experienced in bilingual individuals. Participants will also be helping further and refine minority-focused research, which is traditionally underserved in Psychology and other scientific fields.

WILL I BE PAID FOR TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?

    Compensation
    You will not be compensated for your participation in this research study. Participants who complete the study in full may opt to be included in a raffle for a $100 American Express Gift Card. One winner will be selected and the chance of winning will depend on the total amount of entries received.

    There are no direct costs for completing this study. You will not be reimbursed for any out of pocket expenses indirectly involved with completing this study, such as the use of your personal computer or internet connection for web access.

WHAT HAPPENS IF I WANT TO STOP TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?

    You are free to withdraw from this study at any time. If you decide to withdraw from this study you should close your web browser immediately.

    If you withdraw from the study, the researcher will not contact you.

HOW WILL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION BE KEPT?

    Subject Identifiable Data

    Data Storage
    While the study is open for participation, research data will be collected through a web application and stored on a commercially-secure web server. Once the study is closed, research data will be transferred onto a laptop computer and deleted from the webserver. Data on the laptop will be password protected and only the principal investigator will have access to it.
